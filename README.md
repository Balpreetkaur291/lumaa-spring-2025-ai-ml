# AI/Machine Learning Intern Challenge: Simple Content-Based Recommendation

---

## Overview

This project implements a **content-based recommendation system** that suggests movies similar to a user's input description. It uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to compare user input with movie descriptions and returns the most relevant matches.

## Dataset

- **Source**: The dataset used is **Top 1000 IMDb Movies**. It is available publicly on kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/inductiveanks/top-1000-imdb-movies-dataset
- **Loading Instructions**: The dataset (`Top_1000_IMDb_movies_New_version.csv`) should be placed in the project directory.
- **Columns Used**:
  - `Movie Name`: The title of the movie.
  - `Description`: A brief summary of the movie plot.

## Code Structure

The recommendation system follows a structured pipeline:

Load Data: The dataset is read into a pandas DataFrame, and only relevant columns (Movie Name and Description) are kept.

Transform Data: The text descriptions are vectorized using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which converts them into numerical representations.

Recommend: Using cosine similarity, the system calculates the similarity between the user’s input and the movie descriptions, retrieving the top N most similar movies based on their similarity scores.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed on your system. It is recommended to set up a virtual environment.

### Install Dependencies

1. Create a virtual environment (optional):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install required packages:
   you can install manually:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
   ```

## Running the Code

You can run the script via command line or Jupyter/Google Collab Notebook.

### Command Line Execution

Run the following command, replacing `"Some user description"` with a movie description of your choice. Below is an example:

```sh
python recommend.py "I love thrilling action movies set in space, with a comedic twist."
```

### Jupyter Notebook Execution

1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the notebook containing the recommendation system code.

## Results

Example Output for the query:


I love thrilling action movies set in space, with a comedic twist.


### Expected Output:


Recommended Movies:
